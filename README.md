## 📖 What is EpsteinFiles-RAG?

EpsteinFiles-RAG is a tool that uses a method called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It helps you get smart answers by searching a large dataset called the "Epstein Files 20K" from Hugging Face (by Teyler). You don’t have to be technical to use it. This software lets you ask questions and receive detailed, easy-to-understand responses that pull from the Epstein Files data.

You can think of it like a chatbot that knows a lot about the Epstein Files case and answers questions by looking up facts from the dataset.
